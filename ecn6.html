    <p class="about">
        Ramil Laguda is a passionate and dedicated person from Silang and the owner of ECN Barbershop from Perez, Trece Martires City, whose love for frying has been a lifelong journey. Growing up, Ramil was inspired by the art of hairdressing and was fascinated by how a simple hairstyle can change a person's appearance and boost their confidence. This passion never waned even as he took on various jobs to support his growing family.
        <br>
        <br>
        Ramil is a devoted family man, blessed with a beautiful and hardworking wife Nancy and five wonderful children: Nadine, Ryza, Cj, April and Ethan. His family was his greatest source of inspiration and motivation. Despite the challenges of supporting a large family, Ramil always held onto his dream of opening his own hair salon.
        <br>
        <br>
        With the unwavering support of Nancy and their children, Ramil finally decided to realize his dream. His hair salon is more than just a business; it is the culmination of years of dedication, hard work and the pursuit of a lifelong passion. Ramil's barber shop is a testament to his love for craftsmanship and his commitment to creating a better future for his family. This is where skill meets art and where every customer leaves their best self.
